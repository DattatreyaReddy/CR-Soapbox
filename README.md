## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

CR SOAPBOX is an alternative for Class Representative üòâ.

Students:

- Can get timetable (Up-to-date).
- Can set & get attendance (Bunk manager).
- Can receive announcements (Creation and Deletion of classes, Messages, Files, Polls, etc.).

Teachers:

- Can get personal and grade timetables (Up-to-date).
- Can modify timetable (Create and Cancel classes).
- Can make announcements (messages,polls,files, etc.)

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

- By starting the server the bot will fetch the timetable and other details from the json files in the project.

- The bot uses the Telegram API to fetch messages, Python Telegram Bot module to reply to messages and IIITT server as a server.

- The entire bot is written in Python 3.8

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Start the bot by sending :

```
    /start
```

- The bot will ask the user whether he is a student or teacher.

Student:

- Bot will ask the user to send the IIITT Roll no to log in.
- The bot first extracts the grade from the users roll no, process it and store it in database.
- if the roll no does not exists then it will send an error message.
- Then the bot will responds according to the student's requests.
